The monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus that causes [`Mpox (monkeypox)`](https://www.who.int/health-topics/monkeypox), an infectious viral disease that can occur in both humans and animals. The first human Mpox case was diagnosed in Democratic Republic of the Congo at 1970. A global Mpox outbreak in 2022 marked the first incidence of widespread community transmission outside the African region. Two distinct clades of MPXV have been identified:

Clade I, the former Congo Basin (Central African) clade. The current Clade I outbreak is widespread into countries outside Central/Eastern Africa. No Clade I cases have been reported in the United States at this time.

Clade II, the former West African clade. The global outbreak, caused by the subclade IIb, is still ongoing and has been reported in more than 100 countries. Clade II Mpox is circulating at low levels in the United States.

We maintain five MPXV surveillance dashboards:

[`MPOX-CDC/All-Clades`](https://nextstrain.org/groups/MPOX-CDC/All-Clades) focuses on broader MPXV diversity encompassing sub-sampled clades I and II sequences.

[`MPOX-CDC/Clade-I`](https://nextstrain.org/groups/MPOX-CDC/Clade-I-GenBank) focuses on Clade I MPXV that causes more severe illness and deaths.

[`MPOX-CDC/Clade-IIb`](https://nextstrain.org/groups/MPOX-CDC/Clade-IIb-GenBank) focuses on recent MPXV in Clade IIb transmitting from human to human.

[`MPOX-CDC/Lineage-B`](https://nextstrain.org/groups/MPOX-CDC/Lineage-B-GenBank) focuses on Lineage B.1 MPXV of the global outbreak that started in 2022.

[`MPOX-CDC/Lineage-B-USA`](https://nextstrain.org/groups/MPOX-CDC/Lineage-B-USA-GenBank) focuses on the Lineage B.1 MPXV detected in the United States.
